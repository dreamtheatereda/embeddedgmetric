#summary pure perl module for sending gmetric data to gmond

=Gmetric Perl=

THIS IS ALPHA

It "works" but it's pretty yet.  If you must, look at the source file to use.

== Usage ==

A little something like this:

{{{
my $gm = gmetric_open('localhost', 8649, 'udp');
gmetric_send($gm, 'foo', 'bar', 'string', '', 'both', 60, 60);
gmetric_close($gm);
}}}

== Multicast ==

TO DO.  I'll need to pull in another module to do this.  I think.

== HELP WANTED ==

I'm not a perl expert.  Any help/advice on packaging, making it OO, etc would be welcome!
