#summary Parsing that xml from gmond

= Introduction =

In this installment we are going to parse the output of gmond.  

== Install ==

We are going to use [http://python.org python] with  [http://codespeak.net/lxml/ lxml].   But this is so simple, it borders on use regular expressions.

For you YUM people, using the [https://rpmrepo.org/RPMforge/Using RPMForge] repository, it should be as simple as 

{{{
sudo yum install python-lxml
}}}

otherwise, you'll need [http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html libxml2] first, and manual install lxml.  It should be fairly straight forward.

== The XML ==

For some reason, gmond spits of a full DTD every request.  I do not know why.   Anyway if you are into that type thing, there it is.

Anyways, it's really simple:

{{{
<GANGLIA>
   <HOST NAME="172.16.70.128" >
     <METRIC name="foo" value="bar" ... > ... </METRIC>
     <METRIC name="foo" value="bar" ... > ... </METRIC>
   </HOST>
   <HOST NAME="...">
     etc...
}}}


You'll see a lot of extra stuff.  most of it is self-explanitory.  Most of it I don't use.
