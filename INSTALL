INSTAL INSTRUCTIONS

it's pretty easy.


1) C-Source

If you don't want to deal with a library, just copy the 4 source files to whatever
you want.  Relax, it's the MIT license.

2) Standard

it's the usual ./configure && make && make test && make install hoo-haa.

See ./configure --help for details

3) Python

You can just go into the python directory and do the usual
python setup.py install

it's a whole single file, so it's pretty easy to do what you want with.

OR

#2 will do this all for you.
